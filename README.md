# Crowdfunding-ETL

Overview
In this project we perform an advandced anaylsis for Independent funding. The company has received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who've pledged to the live projects. Indpendent Funding wants us to perform an ETL process and a data anlysis by using SQL queries. In this porject it's necessary to first extract the data, then transform it and then load it in a SQL database. Important steps are to create an ERD and table schema for creating a new table in the database. At the end we perform a data analysis using SQL queries.
